 0010R-hello.html   |           |           |
                    |     L     |     R     |
                    |           |           |
                    +-----------+-----------+

similarly 'A' (above) and 'B' (below).

Allow placement across monitors.

Allow talk notes to be placed permanently on one monitor (is this
useful though?  speaker could just open an editor with the notes
separately).

Allow VTE screens to be skipped when using a wireless pointer (see
NOTES).

Implement a "blank the screen" button (see NOTES).
