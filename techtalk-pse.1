Tech Talk \*(L"Platinum Supreme Edition\*(R" (\s-1PSE\s0) is Linux Presentation
Software designed by technical people to give technical software
demonstrations to other technical people.  It is designed to be simple
to use (for people who know how to use an editor and the command line)
and powerful, so that you can create informative, technically accurate
and entertaining talks and demonstrations.
.PP
Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 is good at opening editors at the right place, opening
shell prompts with preloaded history, compiling and running things
during the demonstration, displaying text, photos, figures and video.
.PP
Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 is \fIbad\fR at slide effects, chart junk and bullet
points.
.PP
This manual page covers all the documentation you will need to use
Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0.  The next section covers running the tool from the
command line.  After that there is a \*(L"\s-1TUTORIAL\s0\*(R" section to get you
started.  Then there is a detailed \*(L"\s-1REFERENCE\s0\*(R" section.  Finally
there is a discussion on \*(L"\s-1WHAT\s0 \s-1MAKES\s0 A \s-1GOOD\s0 \s-1TALK\s0\*(R".
.SH "RUNNING THE TOOL FROM THE COMMAND LINE"

Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 talks are just directories containing \f(CW\*(C`*.html\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`*.sh\*(C'\fR (shell script) and \f(CW\*(C`*.term\*(C'\fR (terminal) files:
.PP

\& 0600\-command\-line.term
\& 9900\-conclusion.html
.Ve

The filenames that Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 considers to be slides have to match
the regular expression:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ^(\ed+)(?:\-.*)\e.(html|sh|term)$
.Ve
.PP
(any other file or subdirectory is ignored).  Shell scripts and

those files and run the \f(CW\*(C`techtalk\-pse\*(C'\fR command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& cd /path/to/talk/; techtalk\-pse
.Ve
.PP
You can also run \f(CW\*(C`techtalk\-pse\*(C'\fR without changing directory, instead
specifying the path to the talk:

[Before you start writing your real talk, I urge you to read
\&\*(L"\s-1WHAT\s0 \s-1MAKES\s0 A \s-1GOOD\s0 \s-1TALK\s0\*(R" below].
.PP
To start your talk, all you have to do is to make a new directory
somewhere:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& mkdir talk
\& cd talk
.Ve
.PP
A tech talk consists of \s-1HTML\s0 files (\*(L"slides\*(R") and shell scripts.  The
filenames must start with a number, followed optionally by a
description, followed by the extension (\f(CW\*(C`.html\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`.sh\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.term\*(C'\fR).
So to start our talk with two slides:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& echo "This is the introduction" > 0010\-introduction.html
\& echo "This is the second slide" > 0020\-second.html
.Ve
.PP
To run it, run the command from within the talk directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& techtalk\-pse
.Ve
.PP
Any other file in the directory is ignored, so if you want to add
Makefiles, version control files etc, just go ahead.
.SS "\s-1TIPS\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1WRITING\s0 \s-1HTML\s0"
.IX Subsection "TIPS FOR WRITING HTML"
You may have your own techniques and tools for writing \s-1HTML\s0, so
this section is just to share my ideas.  I start every
\&\s-1HTML\s0 file with a standard stylesheet and Javascript header:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css"/>
\& <script src="code.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
.Ve
.PP
That just ensures that I can put common styling instructions for all
my slides in a single file (\f(CW\*(C`style.css\*(C'\fR), and I have one place where
I can add all Javascript, if I need to use any (\f(CW\*(C`code.js\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\fI\s-1BACKGROUNDS\s0, \s-1FONTS\s0 \s-1AND\s0 \s-1LOGOS\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "BACKGROUNDS, FONTS AND LOGOS"
.PP
To add a common background and font size to all slides, put this in
\&\f(CW\*(C`style.css\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& body {
\&     font\-size: 24pt;
\&     background: url(background\-image.jpg) no\-repeat;
\& }
.Ve
.PP
To add a logo in one corner:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& body {
\&     background: url(logo.jpg) top right no\-repeat;
\& }
.Ve
.PP
\fI\s-1SCALING\s0 \s-1AND\s0 \s-1CENTERING\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "SCALING AND CENTERING"
.PP
Scaling slide text and images so that they appear at the same
proportionate size for any screen resolution can be done using
Javascript.  (See
<https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/window.innerHeight>).
.PP
If you want to center text horizontally, use \s-1CSS\s0, eg:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& p.center {
\&     text\-align: center;
\& }
.Ve
.PP
To center text vertically, \s-1CSS3\s0 is supposed to offer a solution some
time, but while you're waiting for that try
<http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center#vertical>.
.PP
\fI\s-1PREVIEWING\s0 \s-1HTML\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "PREVIEWING HTML"
.PP
I find it helpful to have Firefox open to display the \s-1HTML\s0 files and
styles as I edit them.  Just start firefox in the talk directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& firefox file://$(pwd) &
.Ve
.PP
When you edit an \s-1HTML\s0 file, click the Firefox reload button to
immediately see your changes.
.PP
Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 uses WebKit embedding to display \s-1HTML\s0.  \s-1HTML\s0 is
standardized enough nowadays that what you see in Firefox and other
browsers should be the same as what Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 displays.
WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari) should be identical.
.SS "\s-1CREATING\s0 \s-1FIGURES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CREATING FIGURES"
Use your favorite tool to draw the figure, convert it to an image (in
any format that the Mozilla engine can display) and include it using
an \f(CW\*(C`<img>\*(C'\fR tag, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <img src="fig1.gif">
.Ve
.PP
Suitable tools include: Inkscape, XFig, GnuPlot, GraphViz, and many
TeX tools such as PicTex and in particular TikZ.
.SS "\s-1EMBEDDING\s0 \s-1VIDEOS\s0, \s-1ANIMATIONS\s0, \s-1ETC\s0."
.IX Subsection "EMBEDDING VIDEOS, ANIMATIONS, ETC."
Using \s-1HTML\s0 5, embedding videos in the browser is easy.  See:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox>
.PP
For animations, you could try Haxe <http://haxe.org/> which has a
Javascript back-end.  There are many other possibilities.
.PP
If you are \fBsure\fR that the venue will have an internet connection,
why not embed a YouTube video.
.SS "\s-1DISPLAYING\s0 \s-1EXISTING\s0 \s-1WEB\s0 \s-1PAGES\s0"
.IX Subsection "DISPLAYING EXISTING WEB PAGES"
Obviously you could just have an \s-1HTML\s0 file that contains a redirect to
the public web page:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <meta http\-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.example.com/">
.Ve
.PP
However if you want your talk to work offline, then it's better to
download the web page in advance, eg. using Firefox's \*(L"Save Page As
\&\-> Web Page, complete\*(R" feature, into the talk directory, then
either rename or make a symbolic link to the slide name:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ln \-s "haXe \- Welcome to haXe.html" 0010\-haxe\-homepage.html
.Ve
.SS "\s-1TIPS\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1WRITING\s0 \s-1SHELL\s0 \s-1SCRIPTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TIPS FOR WRITING SHELL SCRIPTS"
Make sure each \f(CW\*(C`*.sh\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.term\*(C'\fR file you write is executable,
otherwise Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 won't be able to run it.  (The program gives a
warning if you forget this).
.PP
The difference between \f(CW\*(C`*.sh\*(C'\fR (shell script) and \f(CW\*(C`*.term\*(C'\fR (a
terminal script) is that a shell script runs any commands, usually
graphical commands, whereas a terminal script runs in a full screen
terminal.
.PP
A good idea is to start each script by sourcing some common functions.
All my scripts start with:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& #!/bin/bash \-
\& source functions
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW\*(C`functions\*(C'\fR is another file (ignored by Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0) which
contains common functions for setting shell history and starting a
terminal.
.PP
In \f(CW\*(C`functions\*(C'\fR, I have:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& # \-*\- shell\-script \-*\-
\& 
\& # Place any local environment variables required in \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq.
\& if [ \-f local ]; then source local; fi
\& 
\& export PS1="$ "
\& 
\& export HISTFILE=$talkdir/history
\& 
\& rm \-f $HISTFILE
\& touch $HISTFILE
\& 
\& add_history ()
\& {
\&     echo "$@" >> $HISTFILE
\& }
\& 
\& terminal ()
\& {
\&     # Make $HISTFILE unwritable so the shell won\*(Aqt update it
\&     # when it exits.
\&     chmod \-w $HISTFILE
\& 
\&     # Execute a shell.
\&     bash \-\-norc "$@"
\& }
.Ve
.PP
By initializing the shell history, during your talk you can rapidly
recall commands to start parts of the demonstration just by hitting
the Up arrow.  A complete terminal script from one of my talks would
look like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& #!/bin/bash \-
\& source functions
\& add_history guestfish \-i debian.img
\& terminal
.Ve
.PP
This is just a starting point for your own scripts.
.SH "REFERENCE"
.IX Header "REFERENCE"
.SS "\s-1ORDER\s0 \s-1OF\s0 \s-1FILES\s0"
.IX Subsection "ORDER OF FILES"
Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0 displays the slides in the directory in lexicographic
order (the same order as \f(CW\*(C`LANG=C ls \-1\*(C'\fR).  Only files matching the
following regexp are considered:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ^(\ed+)(?:\-.*)\e.(html|sh|term)$
.Ve
.PP
For future compatibility, you should ensure that every slide has a
unique numeric part (ie. \fIdon't\fR have \f(CW\*(C`0010\-aaa.html\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`0010\-bbb.html\*(C'\fR).  This is because in future we want to have the
ability to display multiple files side by side.
.PP
Also for future compatibility, \fIdon't\fR use file names that have an
uppercase letter immediately after the numeric part.  This is because
in future we want to allow placement hints using filenames like
\&\f(CW\*(C`0010L\-on\-the\-left.html\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`0010R\-on\-the\-right.html\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\s-1BASE\s0 \s-1URL\s0 \s-1AND\s0 \s-1CURRENT\s0 \s-1DIRECTORY\s0"
.IX Subsection "BASE URL AND CURRENT DIRECTORY"
The base \s-1URL\s0 is set to the be the directory containing the talk files.
Thus you should use relative paths, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <img src="fig1.gif">
.Ve
.PP
You can also place assets into subdirectories, because subdirectories
are ignored by Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0, eg:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <img src="images/fig1.gif">
.Ve
.PP
When running shell scripts, the current directory is also set to be
the directory containing the talk files, so the same rules about using
relative paths apply there too.
.PP
The environment variable \f(CW$talkdir\fR is exported to scripts and it
contains the absolute path of the directory containing the talk files.
When a script is run, the current directory is the same as
\&\f(CW$talkdir\fR, but if your script changes directory (eg. into a
subdirectory containing supporting files) then it can be useful to use
\&\f(CW$talkdir\fR to refer back to the original directory.
.SH "WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK"
.IX Header "WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK"
I like what Edward Tufte writes, for example his evisceration of
PowerPoint use at \s-1NASA\s0 here:
http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q\-and\-a\-fetch\-msg?msg_id=0001yB <http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB>
.PP
However it is sometimes hard to translate his ideas into clear
presentations, and not all of that is the fault of the tools.  Here
are my thoughts and rules on how to deliver a good talk.
.PP
\&\fBFirst, most important rule:\fR Before you start drawing any slides at
all, write your talk as a short essay.
.PP
This is the number one mistake that presenters make, and it is partly
a tool fault, because PowerPoint, OpenOffice, even Tech Talk \s-1PSE\s0, all
open up on an initial blank slide, inviting you to write a title and
some bullet points.  If you start that way, you will end up using the
program as a kind of clumsy outlining tool, and then reading that
outline to your audience.  That's boring and a waste of time for you
and your audience.  (It would be quicker for them just to download the
talk and read it at home).
.PP
\&\fBSecondly:\fR How long do you want to spend preparing the talk?  A good
talk, with a sound essay behind it, well thought out diagrams and
figures, and interesting demonstrations, takes many hours to prepare.
How many hours?  I would suggest thinking about how many hours of
effort your audience are putting in.  Even just 20 people sitting
there for half an hour is 10 man-hours of attention, and that is a
very small talk, and doesn't include all the extra time and hassle
that it took to get them all in one place.
.PP
I don't think you can get away with spending less than two full days
preparing a talk, if you want to master the topic and draw up accurate
slides.  Steve Jobs was reputed to spend weeks preparing his annual
sales talk to the Apple faithful.
.PP
\&\fBThirdly:\fR Now that you're going to write your talk as an essay, what
should go in the slides?  I would say that you should consider
delivering the essay, \fInot\fR the slides, to people who don't make the
talk.  An essay can be turned into an article or blog posting, whereas
even \*(L"read-out-the-bullet-point\*(R" slides have a low information
density, large size, and end-user compatibility problems (*.pptx
anyone?).
.PP
What, then, goes on the slides?  Anything you cannot just say:
diagrams, graphs, videos, animations, and of course (only with Tech
Talk \s-1PSE\s0!) demonstrations.
.PP
\&\fBLastly:\fR Once you've got your talk as an essay and slides, practice,
practice and practice again.  Deliver the talk to yourself in the
mirror, to your colleagues.  Practice going backwards and forwards
through the slides, using your actual laptop and the software so you
know what to click and what keys to press.  Partly memorize what you
are going to say (but use short notes written on paper if you need
to).
